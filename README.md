# data-structures-and-algorithms
Hola, this is a repository built with the California Golden Standards in mind (Meaning this is built with beauty and excellence in mind). This is my Data Structures and Algorithms notebook to help with your learning of the fundamentals of time and space complexity, asymptotic analysis, and many different implementations of various abstract data types. Vamos! 

Best, 

Don Ricardo De José El Jiménez Sparks
