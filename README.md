Hola, I am Don Ricardo De José El Jiménez Sparks. 

Majoring in: Computer Science & Aerospace Engineering 

An Analytical Multilingual computer programmer with an interest in artificial intelligence, blockchain development, and virtual reality. Adapts quickly to new environments and thrives on multiple tasks. 


this is a repository built with the California Golden Standards in mind (Meaning this is built with beauty and excellence in mind). This is my Data Structures and Algorithms notebook to help with your learning of the fundamentals of time and space complexity, asymptotic analysis, and many different implementations of various abstract data types. Vamos! 


Objective: Design a fun yet beautiful and futuristic programming course(s) taught in

- English 
- Spanish (We will design a new programming language)
- Mandarin (We will design a new programming language)

by Don Ricardo virtually and in-person meetups across the golden nation-state, California. Ultimately this project is one of many projects to lay the foundation of combining multiple skills into a final end product or service creation. This project will move past the Metaverse Architect field of Higher Education and onto other domains within the realms of iOS development, robotics software engineering, and beyond.   



Best, 

Don Ricardo De José El Jiménez Sparks
